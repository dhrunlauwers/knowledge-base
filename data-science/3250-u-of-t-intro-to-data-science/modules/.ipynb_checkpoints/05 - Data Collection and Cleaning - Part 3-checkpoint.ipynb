    "## Data Preparation \n",

    "### Tidy Data Makes It Easier\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tidy Data** (Wickham, 2014) is the concept of a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables align with observations,\n",
    "variables and types. We begin by defining what clean data actually means.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tidy Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In tidy data the following standardization applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each dataset column represents one variable.\n",
    "* Each observation forms a row.\n",
    "* Each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, the focus is put on a single dataset rather than the many connected datasets common in relational databases. By definition, *Messy data* is any other arrangement of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidy data eases variable extraction because of the standardized structure of the dataset. In tidy data,  each row represents an observation. It is the result of one treatment across all observations. Each column is a variable. For messy data, you need to use different strategies to extract different variables, slowing analysis and introducing errors. If you consider how many data analysis operations involve all of the values in a variable (i.e., every aggregation function for calculating statistical summaries), then the importance of simplified extraction becomes apparent. Tidy data is suited for vectorized programming (like the `pandas` library), because the layout ensures paired values across variables for an observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of organizing variables is by their role or use in the analysis. For example, is the variable for indexing the observation (i.e., treatment type, observation time stamp), or is it an actual measured value of the observation? **Measured variables** are what we actually measure in an experiment. Indexes should come first, followed by measured variables, each ordered so that related variables are grouped together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tidying Messy Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Real datasets are often not tidy. In this section we describe the most common problems\n",
    "with messy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Column headers are values, not variable names.\n",
    "* Multiple variables are stored in one column.\n",
    "* Variables are stored in both rows and columns.\n",
    "* Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.\n",
    "* A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most messy datasets can be tidied with a small set of tools. The following subsections illustrate each problem and show how to tidy them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Column headers as values\n",
    "\n",
    "Most messy datasets are tabular data designed for presentation. Variables will form both the rows and columns, and column headers are values rather than variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these situations, we need to turn columns into rows. In most software packages, this is known as a *reshaping* but more precisely known as *melting*. This operation simply introduces two new variables, while removing the columns converted into rows. One new variable holds the column header values as its range of values. The other new variable holds the value for that observation and where the first new variable has the appropriate column header as its value. Or to be more concise, multiple columns are converted into two columns which act as key-value pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*UUYfreWsYZRpeQ3AF6aESQ.png' height=\"500\" width=\"500\" alt=\"reshape operation\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A common use of this messy data format is to record observations over time (i.e., converting multiple columns specific to different time steps into two columns). Keeping the messy format reduces duplication because each time step would need its own row, and observation metadata would repeat over multiple rows for one observation."

In this section we focus on strings manipulation and introduce basic regular expressions."

    "Regular expressions allow matching with more precision than traditional string matching functions. This is because a regular expression is actually compiled into a simple automata/program which has only one purpose: match on a string for the pattern used to compile the expression. A **regular expression** is the simplest program possible in both practical and theoretical terms. It is literally a program without any memory (i.e., stack, heap, swap, etc.). Regular expressions only have the ability to process data, they are theoretically incapable of storing data (*although most modern implementations don't adhere to this restriction*). As such, they are guaranteed to run at least as fast or faster than any alternative for matching strings.\n",

    "| `?` | Matches 0 or 1 occurrences of a string. | The regex `\"columns?\"` will match both `\"column\"` and its plural, `\"columns\"`. |\n",

    "Up to this point, we've touched lightly on how to relabel missing data via `NaN`'s or `NA`. But this task can become rather involved. For example, financial spreadsheets often mix reporting, calculation work-flow and data entry, resulting in multiple tables in one spreadsheet. Loading all this into `pandas` can be strange. Especially if cells have been merged.\n",

    "#### Relational Joins\n",
    "`pandas` provides `merge()` as the entry point to standard database join operations between `DataFrame` objects. `join()` is a special case of `merge()` known as the *inner join*. However, in `pandas`, `merge()` is a general operator, while `join()` is a `Dataframe` local operator. This means the `merge()` operation will automatically join on columns with the same name for inner joins. Inner joins imply an equality check for all shared columns between two tables.\n",

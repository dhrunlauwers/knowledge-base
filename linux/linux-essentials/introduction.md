# Intro to Linux: The OS and the Community

#### What is Linux?
- Linux is an operating system

#### Where did Linux come from?
- Based on UNIX developed by Bell Labs
- Linus Torvalds created a popular UNIX variant and released the source code online, AKA. LINUX
- Thousands of other developers have since developed the LINUX operating system
- It runs many appliances, websites, routers, and other kinds of hardware

#### Why is LINUX free?
- GNU project set out to release source code to public
- Allows anyone to make improvements to it, which encouraged Linus to release his kernel

#### Open Source Philosophy
- software should be free
- free from vendor or government control
- all applications should be distributed with source code

### Distributions
#### Why are there so many?
- Remember the GNU project.. 
- Many distributions have a specific goal
- They are all Linux, they have just been configured in different ways

#### Components of a Linux Distribution
- Lunix kernel
- Core utilities - software components: bash shell, networking utilities, etc.
- Supplemental Software - desktop software, services
- System services - security, login, etc.

#### Common Linux Distributions
- **Slackware**: Need to compile software in order to install it (old)
- **Debian**: Wellknown for stable releaess
- **RedHat Enterprise Linux**: known for running on servers with stable software and support
- **Ubuntu**: Based on Debian with more usability features
- **Fedora**: Owned by RedHat, geared towards a workstation environment
- **CentOS**: For server environments, rebuild of RedHat Linux but not associated with RedHat support

#### Which one to use?
